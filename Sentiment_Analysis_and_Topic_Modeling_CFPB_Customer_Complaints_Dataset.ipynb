        "The following code takes public complaints data sent to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and performs a variety of sentiment analysis methods on it in an attempt to quantify the amount of positive and/or negative sentiment customers have toward different credit card providers in the United States.  Some of these sentiment scores were merged with another CFPB 'dataset containing information on more than 650 available US credit cards, assigning these sentiment scores to each card. this merged dataset was then used to build the credit card search tool contained in the other file in thie github repository. the datasets mentioned can be found at the links provided below.\n",

A part of the requirement is teams to \"uncover underlying trends, feelings, themes, and concepts that reveal consumers’ perspectives about different credit cards\" as well as to focus the credit card comparison tool on \"the total cost of credit card ownership.\" The first aspect of the project involves analyzing the consumer complaints dataset. Many approaches are available in this set of notes, some sentiment analysis and topic modeling approaches are discussed.\n",

        "2. Lexicon or rule based methods such as Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob use predefined sets of rules and lexicons to estimate sentiment directly from text without needing further training. These can be applied directly to unlabeled texts. In addition, lexicon based models has been proven to provide reasonable accuracy. Specifically, VADER has performed well compared to TextBlob for getting sentiment of review (Barai 2024) and tweet data(Singh et al. 2022). For example, Singh et al. (2022) utilize a weak-supervision method (the data is labeled using lexicon based methods and supervised machine learning models are applied). Singh et al. (2022) manually observed 500 instances (text) and found that VADER, TextBlob, and NLTK predicted 427, 415, and 398 instances correctly, respectively. Although it must be noted that the data used was twitter for which VADER was designed.\n",

        "* \\* (asterisk): Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
        "* \\+ (plus): Matches 1 or more of the preceding element.\n",
        "* ? (question mark): Makes the preceding element optional, matching either 0 or 1 times.\n",
        "* {n}: Matches exactly n occurrences of the preceding element.\n",

        "### VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)\n",
        "VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to analyze social media text. It is widely recognized for its efficiency in capturing the sentiment expressed in short, informal, and context-rich text, such as tweets, reviews, and comments. Developed by C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, VADER has become a popular choice for researchers and practitioners due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of VADER\n",
        "1. **Lexicon-Based Approach:** VADER utilizes a predefined list of words (lexicon) that are annotated with sentiment scores. These scores reflect the general sentiment associated with each word, ranging from highly negative to highly positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rule-Based Adjustments:** In addition to the lexicon, VADER applies several heuristics and rules to account for the context and intensity of sentiments. For example:\n",
        "  *   **Punctuation:** Exclamation marks (!) and question marks (?) can intensify the sentiment.\n",
        "  *   **Capitalization:** Words in uppercase letters are perceived as more intense.\n",
        "  *   **Degree Modifiers:** Words that amplify (e.g., \"very\") or diminish (e.g., \"slightly\") sentiment are taken into consideration.\n",
        "  *   **Conjunctions:** But, and, or other conjunctions can alter the sentiment of the preceding or following phrases.\n",
        "3. **Sentiment Scores:** VADER provides four sentiment metrics:\n",
        "  * **Negative:** The proportion of the text that conveys negative sentiment.\n",
        "  * **Neutral:** The proportion of the text that conveys neutral sentiment.\n",
        "  * **Positive:** The proportion of the text that conveys positive sentiment.\n",
        "  * **Compound:** A normalized score that represents the overall sentiment of the text, ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a simple demonstration of VADER's algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalized positive, negative and neutral score is found my summing the scores and dividing by the sum of positive, negative and neutral scores.\n",
